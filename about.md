Hey, I'm Abraham Galindo. I'm a Software Developer currently focusing in SharePoint development.

I've been working with SharePoint for more thant 7 years, I started with 2010 version but most of the projects I worked on were in 2013 version. I participated on creating intranets and internal system for clients storing all data in SharePoint or connecting with other applications.

I try to focus on the latest technologies and products that I'm currently using like SPFx, SharePoint Online, PnPjs, etc. but sometimes it's difficult to follow up. Also I have been working as freelance for a couple of projects defining architechture or just being a team memmber.

This does not mean that I dont try or take a look at other technologies or frameworks, I just want to know a little bit about everything.

As a team lead I'm discovering new phases of my professional growth sharing my acquired experience with my teammates and help them with any question they could have.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any concern or if you just want to say hello!.
